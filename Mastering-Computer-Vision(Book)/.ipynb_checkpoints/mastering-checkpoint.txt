Chapter 1:

The topics we will be covering in this chapter are as follows:

. Detecting edges using image hashing and filtering.
. Extracting features from an image.
. Object detection using Contours and the HOG detector.
. An overview of TensorFlow, its ecosystem, and installation.

 - Perpetual hash (phash): A cosine transformation.
 - Difference hash (dhash): The difference between adjacent pixels.
 
1. Using a Bayer filter for color pattern formation.
2. Creating an image vector.
3. Transforming the image.
4. Linear filtering—convolution with kernels.
5. Mixing Gaussian and Laplacian filters.
6. Detecting edges in the image.

Chapter 2:

Content Recognition LBP:

- Processing images using LBP
- Applying LBP to texture recognition
- Matching Face color with foundation - LBP and its limitaions
- Matching face color with foudantion color - color matching.

LBO is grayscale image thresholding operation that´s used to classify images based on distinct patterns.
Compared the neighborhood pixel value with that of the center pixel value.
